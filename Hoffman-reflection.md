What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I knew all the commands for git flow but did not completely understand what they were doing. For instance I did not understand the difference between creating a directory and a branch. Now I know that directories are on your local computer and branches are related to github. I also was confused about what the 'git pull' command did, but now I understand that it merges changes to your branch to the master branch. The merge conflict section was slightly confusing but once we went through it I was able to understand the process and believe I could fix a conflict I encountered in the future.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
In my above answer I touch on a few things that were clarified for me, mainly relating to what the commands actually do. In addition, we talked about the naming procedures for commits and I understand them now.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I only had my guide and I asked her technical questions mainly in regards to directories vs. branches, and what exactly adding a file meant and if each time you pushed a file it automatically updated in github with your changes. I also asked about merging a branch and now know that the purpose is to merge from your branch to the master. 

What still confuses you about git?
At the moment I do not have any questions about git, since my guide went overtime to answer anything I was curious or confused about. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
My guide acted as my navigator and I really enjoyed the experience and found it extremely helpful and benefitial to my learning process.
